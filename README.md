# Welcome to your Expo app ðŸ‘‹

This is an [Expo](https://expo.dev) project created with [`create-expo-app`](https://www.npmjs.com/package/create-expo-app).

## Get started

1. Install dependencies

   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the app

   ```bash
   npx expo start
   ```

In the output, you'll find options to open the app in a

- [development build](https://docs.expo.dev/develop/development-builds/introduction/)
- [Android emulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/android-studio-emulator/)
- [iOS simulator](https://docs.expo.dev/workflow/ios-simulator/)
- [Expo Go](https://expo.dev/go), a limited sandbox for trying out app development with Expo

You can start developing by editing the files inside the **app** directory. This project uses [file-based routing](https://docs.expo.dev/router/introduction).

## Assumptions you made
1. The main functionalities include product listing, single product preview, adding items to the cart, viewing the cart, and proceeding to checkout.  
2. No API calls were made; product data was retrieved from a local FakeApi and stored locally.  
3. A filtering system for product listings has been implemented, allowing users to filter by category and price.  

## What youâ€™d improve with more time

1: Add more filter functionalities when sorting products
